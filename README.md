# Configure Google Drive OAuth and Save Access Token
In this article I am going to help you setup an oauth key in google drive and use a simple technique  to save the access token. So, this will enable us not to verify access everytime we make an api call. 
Now, first go to [Google's developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Here you will create your oAuth2.0 key. Now, go [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/enable-drive-api) and follow there instructions to create your oauth key.
